# Named Entity Recognition (NER) using BERT

This project implements Named Entity Recognition (NER) using BERT, a state-of-the-art language model developed by Google. NER is a subtask of information extraction that aims to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, etc.

## Project Overview

- **Data Preparation**: The project involves preparing the data for NER training and evaluation. This includes preprocessing the text data and labeling named entities using the CoNLL 2003 dataset.

- **Tokenization**: BERT tokenization is applied to convert the text data into tokens suitable for model input.

- **Model Training and Fine-tuning**: BERT model is trained and fine-tuned on the labeled data to recognize named entities in text.

- **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics to assess its performance in identifying named entities accurately.

- **Deployment**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for efficient entity recognition in unstructured text data.
